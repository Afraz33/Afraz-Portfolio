                <p>It‚Äôs all started with phone call ‚ÄúWanna go to Desert Rally?‚Äù an hour before departure. #Unplanned-Tour And I accepted without getting details. Plan was to visit Derawar fort for the final round of Jeep Rally ‚Äî in-depth planned to meet Mooroo bhai who unfortunately left a day before.ü•∫</p>

                    <p>Our team includes Rana Mubashir Ali, Sardar Ali, Maviya, Aimal Qurashi, Talha Sufi, Majid and myself. Talha and Majid specially came from Faisalabad to attend this event.</p>
                </div>
                <p>On 15th Feb at 6 pm we reached at the starting point of the race.
                    First difficulty we have to face was no network, it was also the + point ‚Äôcause we were enjoying the real moment instead of using the phones. And the other was no-one to guide the ways.In the evening we visited Shahi Mosque, Derawar Fort and the Fair around it. Found out the history and the importance of the fort. After taking some photos we began to look for our host Sheikh Noor Muhammad. At last we got him at 10 pm. He welcomed us so warmly. He offered us dinner and a place for sleep.üòò</p>

                    <p>Then we went to the concert where Nadeem Abbas won Heart‚ù§Ô∏è by his beautiful voice and the lyrics. The other Artists also performed very well.</p>
                </div>
                <p>After this we met other friends who also came there for the race, had some tea with them. They guided us for the next. It was great to meet them. And then our guys decided full night chill/bonfire/music/dance but I preferred sleepüòÖ.</p>
                <p>The next day on 16th of February it was the final round of Jeep Rally. We getup early in the morning and went to starting point of the race. Did some photo-shoot, meet new people and then move forward. Our vehicle wasn‚Äôt able to go far of so Talha and Majid got lift for the next point. They went about 30 km far for the photo-shoot, but it went wrong when because of no network we couldn‚Äôt contact with them. According to plan we have to get out of this place before 11 so that we would be safe from rush. And after a long wait when even the rush was finished and only we were alone in the desert they came. And here‚Äôs our trip ends.</p>
                <p id="quote"><b>There are no goodbyes for us. Where ever you‚Äôre you will be always in my heart.</b></p>
                <p>The main goal of the trip was the gathering after a long time and the photo-shoot of the event. Both went so well. We get best shoots and spent a very good time together. The trip was also very informative as we found out the history of fort, the race and the night at desert.
                    Really it was the great experience!!!</p>
