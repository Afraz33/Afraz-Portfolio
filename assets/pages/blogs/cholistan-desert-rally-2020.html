              It‚Äôs all started with phone call ‚ÄúWanna go to Desert Rally?‚Äù an
              hour before departure. #Unplanned-Tour And I accepted without
              getting details. Plan was to visit Derawar fort for the final
              round of Jeep Rally ‚Äî in-depth planned to meet Mooroo bhai who
              unfortunately left a day before.ü•∫

                Our team includes Rana Mubashir Ali, Sardar Ali, Maviya, Aimal
                Qurashi, Talha Sufi, Majid and myself. Talha and Majid specially
                came from Faisalabad to attend this event.

              On 15th Feb at 6 pm we reached at the starting point of the race.
              First difficulty we have to face was no network, it was also the +
              point ‚Äôcause we were enjoying the real moment instead of using the
              phones. And the other was no-one to guide the ways.In the evening
              we visited Shahi Mosque, Derawar Fort and the Fair around it.
              Found out the history and the importance of the fort. After taking
              some photos we began to look for our host Sheikh Noor Muhammad. At
              last we got him at 10 pm. He welcomed us so warmly. He offered us
              dinner and a place for sleep.üòò

              <p>
                Then we went to the concert where Nadeem Abbas won Heart‚ù§Ô∏è by
                his beautiful voice and the lyrics. The other Artists also
                performed very well.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              After this we met other friends who also came there for the race,
              had some tea with them. They guided us for the next. It was great
              to meet them. And then our guys decided full night
              chill/bonfire/music/dance but I preferred sleepüòÖ.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day on 16th of February it was the final round of Jeep
              Rally. We getup early in the morning and went to starting point of
              the race. Did some photo-shoot, meet new people and then move
              forward. Our vehicle wasn‚Äôt able to go far of so Talha and Majid
              got lift for the next point. They went about 30 km far for the
              photo-shoot, but it went wrong when because of no network we
              couldn‚Äôt contact with them. According to plan we have to get out
              of this place before 11 so that we would be safe from rush. And
              after a long wait when even the rush was finished and only we were
              alone in the desert they came. And here‚Äôs our trip ends.

            </p>
            <p>
              The main goal of the trip was the gathering after a long time and
              the photo-shoot of the event. Both went so well. We get best
              shoots and spent a very good time together. The trip was also very
              informative as we found out the history of fort, the race and the
              night at desert. Really it was the great experience!!!
