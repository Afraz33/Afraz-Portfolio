                In quarantine, our timeline is narrowed. Instead of thinking about the future in months or years, we think days or weeks.

                We’re stuck at home. We can’t hang out with your friends. But that doesn’t mean that we can do nothing.
                It could be weeks. It could be months. Nobody knows.
                The question is: what are you going to do with this time?

                · You could start a new game. <br>
· You could start a new TV series.<br>
· You could stare out the window at the empty streets around you.<br>
· You could sleep all day.<br><br>
Or you could take control.
It could be time to learn and time to plan for the future. It’s up to you which path you choose.
You can make it useful just by taking one step. And that step is making a start. Start exploring your dreams. Start exploring the opportunities you have. Whatever you wanted to become in your life that’s the right moment for you to explore that. Start learning the skills which you ever wanted to learn in your life.
If you wanna learn something you don’t need to go somewhere to learn and you don’t even need money, you just need time. And with the Coronavirus floating out there, you’ve probably got more time than ever.
If you want to be something after the coronavirus blew over, start preparing now.<br><br>
🛠 Build your skills.<br>
🔊 Build your reputation.<br>
🌎 Build your network.<br>
Use online tools to build these today.<br><br>
Stay home. But don’t despair.
People underestimate just how many free learning resources are out there like freeCodeCamp, SoloLearn and many more. They not even provide you the best material but also give the certificates of completion which are very helpful.
Now even the paid online learning platforms start providing their services for free. Coursera is giving 100 certificates for free. Pluralsight is free for April.
The main skills I recommend everyone learn in 2020 are:
· HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
· Computer Science concepts, algorithms, data structures, and databases
· Python or Java or whichever language you like
· Command line tools like Linux, Git, and Bash
And some other skills that would be helpful:
· Small business basics — how to find freelance customers, how to do basic sales, accounting
· And job application basics — how to pass technical interviews, how to negotiate a high salary
· How to earn professional certifications that can make it easier to get a developer job

              <p>
                These skills not only help to pass your time but also will be very helpful in the future.
I will end by wishing you and your family safe passage through this difficult time. Let’s prepare for the immense amount of work that we’ll need to do when the dust settles.
Stay strong, And happy coding. 👍
